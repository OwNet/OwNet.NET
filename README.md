OwNet.NET
=========

.NET implementation of the OwNet proxy, Windows Phone app and ASP.NET services

OwNet is a project that aims to help schools and individuals with poor
Internet connectivity get better access to the Web.
The main part of OwNet is a proxy application that employs caching and
prefetching of websites to speed up their load times.
The website cache is stored on the users' computers and is accessible from all
computers running OwNet on the local network.

OwNet also provides a social portal for students to share links to
websites, create groups and chat on the local network.

## Deployment and state of the project

We have participated with NGOs from Slovakia to deploy OwNet in schools in Kenya.
We were successful in installing OwNet in several schools, however further work
is required to include OwNet in their teaching process.

The development of OwNet has been suspended.
The available source code contains several known bugs and issues that still need
to be resolved.
